# --- Development Environment Configuration ---

# Uses a separate database file to avoid polluting production metrics.
SQLITE_DB_PATH="data/metrics_dev.db"


# --- Cloudflare Worker Configuration ---

# Secret key to authenticate requests to the Cloudflare Worker.
# This must match the 'SECRET_KEY' environment variable configured in your Worker.
# For Dev, this should match the key expected by the Mock Server (default: dev_secret).
SECRET_KEY="dev_secret"

# Full URL of the Worker endpoint that receives the heartbeat.
# For Dev, use the internal mock server URL.
# Example: http://mock-server:8080/api/heartbeat
HEARTBEAT_URL="http://mock-server:8080/api/heartbeat"


# --- n8n Local Webhook ---

# URL of the n8n webhook that receives alerts if the Cloudflare Worker's status changes.
# Used to notify if the cloud service itself fails or recovers.
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=""


# --- Service Health Checks (Optional) ---

# Comma-separated list of service names to check.
# These names are used to construct the SERVICE_URL_<name> variables below.
# Example: SERVICE_NAMES="webapp,database,api,my_container"
SERVICE_NAMES=""

# URL for each service defined in SERVICE_NAMES.
# The variable name must follow the format SERVICE_URL_<service_name>.
# Supports HTTP/HTTPS URLs and the special "docker:" protocol to check container status directly.
# Example: SERVICE_URL_webapp="http://my-app.local"
# Example: SERVICE_URL_database="docker:postgres_container_name"
# Example: SERVICE_URL_api="https://api.example.com/health"

# Optional: Custom headers for specific service checks.
# Format: SERVICE_HEADERS_<service_name>="Header-Name:Header-Value"
# Example: SERVICE_HEADERS_api="x-api-key:secret123"


# --- DNS Optimization (Optional) ---

# If set, this IP will be used to directly access services whose hostnames match a monitored service URL.
# This bypasses external DNS resolution and can optimize latency in Docker/local network setups.
# Example: INTERNAL_DNS_OVERRIDE_IP="127.0.0.1"
INTERNAL_DNS_OVERRIDE_IP=""
